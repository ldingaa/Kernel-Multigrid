# Reproducibility code for “Kernel Multigrid: Accelerate Back-fitting via Sparse Gaussian Process Regression.”

 **Breast Cancer:** In MATLAB, run `KMG_cancer.m` using `cancer_data.mat`.
 **Wine Quality:** In MATLAB, run `KMG_wine.m` using `wine.mat`.
 **SUSY:** Obtain `SUSY.mat` (file is too large to host) by emailing [liang\_ding@fudan.edu.cn](mailto:liang_ding@fudan.edu.cn). Alternatively, download the original SUSY dataset from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/279/susy](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/279/susy) and convert it to a MATLAB `.mat` file. Then run `KMG_susy_1_2.m` or `KMG_susy_3_2.m`.
